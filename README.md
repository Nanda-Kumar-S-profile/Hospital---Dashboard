## Project Insight
The Power BI dashboard for the Hospital Emergency Room was designed to deliver data-driven insights across multiple operational dimensions. Key insights derived from the analysis include:

Patient Volume Trends: Identified peak days and seasonal fluctuations in ER visits, aiding in staff allocation and resource planning.

Average Wait Time: Spikes in patient wait times were detected on specific weekdays, suggesting the need for operational optimization or scheduling adjustments.

Satisfaction Score Analysis: Periods of lower patient satisfaction scores aligned with high wait times, pointing to a direct correlation between service delay and patient sentiment.

Department Referrals: Certain departments consistently received higher patient referrals, indicating potential overload or specialty demand that may require resource redistribution.

Demographics Breakdown: Age, gender, and race analysis helped in understanding the patient population better, useful for targeted healthcare service planning.

Timeliness Metric: Monitored how often patients were seen within 30 minutes of arrival, providing a benchmark for operational efficiency.

Hourly Trends: Identified peak times during the day, enabling time-specific staffing strategies.


## Final Conclusion:
Actionable intelligence to support decision-making.  
A foundation for performance monitoring and continuous improvement in patient care delivery.
The dashboard empowers hospital stakeholders to proactively identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient satisfaction, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of the emergency department
